		<h1>Software Engineering - Week 1 (Aug. 30 - Sept. 1)</h1>
		
		<p>Hello and welcome to my CS373 Software Engineering blog!</p>
		
		<p>
			This particular blog will serve to review what I have learned every week of the semester in my CS373 class. For this first entry I will not spend too much time with the explanation because we mainly introduced ourselves and the basic tools that we are to use.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			To be clear, I will give my review of the week's lessons in a question-and-answer form. Without further ado, here are the questions!
		</p>
		
		<h4>What are your expectations of the class?</h4>
		
		<p>
			With a name like "Software Engineering", I hope to learn some industry-standard practices and tools in order to be better prepared for working in the programming industry.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What did you do this past week?</h4>
		
		<p>
			As stated above, we introduced ourselves to each other and also introduced the tools that we are to use during the semester.
		</p>
		
		
		<h4>What's in your way?</h4>
		
		<p>
			For now the only thing in my way of succeeding in the course is that I am still in a summer-vacation mindset! I almost forgot that I had a blog to post for this here class!
		</p>
		
		<h4>What will you do next week?</h4>
		
		<p>
			Next week will be a short week (yay Labor Day!), but I plan to get the assigned reading done before the Wednesday class and start on the first project when it is assigned.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What's my experience in the class?</h4>
		
		<p>
			Though I can not say much since I have only been to two class meetings, I think the professor is good at communicating to the class. His question-and-answer style of teaching engages the student, and if the student does not know the answer he knows when to jump in and continue the lesson in a way that is not demeaning at all. I like that.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h4>
		
		<p>
			Again, since I am only one week into the semester I can not say much, but perhaps shaking off the "summer laziness" before the semester starts could help in remembering to complete the early assignments.
		</p>
		
		<br />
		
		<p>
			That's it for now! See you all next week!
		</p>
