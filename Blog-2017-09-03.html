		<h1>Software Engineering - Week 1 (Aug. 30 - Sept. 1)</h1>
		
		<p>Hello and welcome to my CS373 Software Engineering blog!</p>
		
		<p>
			This particular blog will serve to review what I have learned every week of the semester in my CS373 class. For this first entry I will not spend too much time with the explanation because we mainly introduced ourselves and the basic tools that we are to use.
		</p>
		
		<p>To be clear, I will give my review of the week's lessons in a question-and-answer form. Without further ado, here are the questions!</p>
