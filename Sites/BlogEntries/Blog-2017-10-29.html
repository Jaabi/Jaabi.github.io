		<h1>Software Engineering - Week 9 (Oct. 23 - Oct. 27)</h1>
		
		<p>Hello and welcome to the ninth-week review of the Software Engineering course!</p>
		
		<p>
			So, this week we stopped learning about Python-specific topics and moved on to SQL lessons! I believe all those who read this blog will know enough of programming languages to know what SQL is, but, for those who do not know, SQL is a language built specifically for data retrieval from a database. It was definitely a nice change of topics!
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Anyway, enough with the review. On to the questions and answers!
		</p>
		
		<br />
		
		<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			This past week saw the completion of phase two of the internet database project and, as stated above, the introduction of a new programming language! The second phase was a rough one. We had to split our team into two: frontend and backend. This is the first time, alongside my other class this semester, that I have ever had only a subset of my team that I could count on for immediate help, so this was something!
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
		
		<p>
			As said before, my other classes are in the way, and I can't do a thing 'bout that. C'est la vie, unfortunately.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			I will try to catch up with my other classes now that this hectic phase is done with, but I have a feeling phase three will not be any easier. Anyway, I will also try to keep up with the reading and do well on the quizzes.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my experience in the class?</h3>
		
		<p>
			My opinion is the same as ever: I like the way Professor Downing teaches, but the lectures have little, if anything, to do with the projects themselves. It is kind of a drag, but I do see how this prepares us for the future. Except, ya' know, I will not have to attend school anymore, and I will have a ton of free time. (Just so you all know, I have a thing against school. Not education. Just school.)
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			Keep at it. This is tough, but keep at it. This will pass. And, hey, if you are a senior, have a good GPA, and need one or two more semesters to graduate, remember what one of my senior team members once said: "C's get degrees." Now, obviously, try your best and do not be a drag to your team, but you are in a good spot. Smile. c:

			I hope you are all enjoying this! See you all next time!
