		<h1>Software Engineering - Week 12 (Nov. 13 - Nov. 17)</h1>
		
		<p>Hello and welcome to the review of the twelfth week of the Software Engineering course!</p>
		
		<p>
			Unfortunately, I missed both Monday and Friday of this week, so some answers will not be as detailed as others. Sorry for the inconvenience
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Moving right along, the questions need some answers!
		</p>
		
		<br />
		
		<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			This past week, we learned about method overriding, dynamic binding, the singleton pattern, and reflection. These were all in the Java language, of course. Sadly, these are the lessons that I missed, so I have a bit of work to do to catch up. The class I did not miss, however, was the class on ethics in for software engineers. Though not comprehensive, this lecture highlighted the importance of morality in coding.
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
		
		<p>
			For the rest of the semester, the things that will stand in my way will be my other classes. There is no changing that, I am afraid.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			Next week is the start of the Thanksgiving break! As such, this will be a short week with only one day of lecture for this class. I do not know what next week's only lecture will be about, so I do not know what I will do. Let us wait and see!
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my experience in the class?</h3>
		
		<p>
			My opinion still has not changed: Professor Downing's style of teaching is still great, still tangentially related to the projects, and still engaging. Nothing new to report on this front.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			Take care of your health! The reason I missed Friday's lecture is because I got sick again. People keep thinking it is okay to work in close proximity to others while coughing up a storm. People will, sadly, keep doing this, so do take care of yourself and ask them to cover themselves well when coughing -- a simple hand-to-mouth motion will not cut it.
		</p>
		
		<br />
		
		<p>
			That is all for this entry! See you all next time!
