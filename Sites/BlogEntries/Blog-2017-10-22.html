		<h1>Software Engineering - Week 8 (Oct. 16 - Oct. 20)</h1>
		
		<!-- Intro paragraph and transition to Q&A section -->
		<p>
			Welcome to the seventh installment of the weekly blog! Unfortunately, I was quite sick this week, so I missed two of the three lectures. Thank goodness the notes are online because this week's topics were great with my personal favorites being the cross-join and theta-join ideas. They seem very useful!
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Enough about my lack of attendance. Time for the questions!
		</p>
		
		<!-- Q&A -->
		
		<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			I spent most of my time confined to my room, and I did very little studying. As implied in the introduction, I read the class notes and got caught up, but I do not think I got the best education that way. Still, it is a good thing the professor posts the notes online. I appreciate that.
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
		
		<p>
			Sickness! In all seriousness, not much is in the way. Well, not much that I can control. I still have two other projects for two classes plus their homework, and, well, I suppose all this headache comes with the territory. That's student life, and I can't deny it.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			I will help my teammates with this project as much as I can. I missed our project meetings because of how sick I was, but I feel better and ready to tackle the project now.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my experience in the class?</h3>
		
		<p>
			For this week, I do not have much to say since I was sick. Sorry, everyone!
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			Get your flu shots early! Even though it did not help me with how long I was sick (for the curious, one whole week), it definitely helped me with the severity. Though I was confined to my room, I was not bedridden nor in tremendous pain like in the past. Seriously, get your vaccinations!
		</p>

			That is all for this week. See you all in the next post!
