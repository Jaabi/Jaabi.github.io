		<h1>Software Engineering - Week 5 (Sept. 25 - Sept. 29)</h1>
		
		<!-- Intro paragraph and transition to Q&A section -->
		<p>
			I still remember the 21st of September, but it is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85pScqSONjc">time to move on to October</a>. And what better way than to recount the last week of September in the Software Engineering course! So, last week saw a few new Python-specific lectures and a whole lot of work on project two -- the first phase of the web project. It went well, but only because the team pulled their weight. I am thankful that my team is also good at the roles they chose to have.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Anyway, enough blabbering! Time to get to the juicy questions and answers!
		</p>
		
		<!-- Q&A -->
		
		<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			This past week I learned a lot more about the weird parts of Python. Specifically, I learned about iterators, iterable "things", the for-in loop, and how Python implements iterable and indexable objects. Those lectures were educational, but what my team and I did outside of class was what really dominated the entire week. The division of labor, meetings, and actual work were the main cause of my stress this week, but the web site was worth it. Seeing the web site up was a proud moment for us all, and I can not wait to see it when it is finished.
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
		
		<p>
			For now, the only things that I have in the way are other classes. Unfortunately, I can not do anything about that other than to plan around them as best as I can. That and hoping for easy assignments in my other classes, but we all know that will never happen. Sad.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			What will I do? More of the same, really. I think I have a groove going, and I will do my best to continue it. I will confess that I have not read last week's reading assignment, so I will try to find the time to read this week. It will be tough, but I think I can manage it.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my experience in the class?</h3>
		
		<p>
			So far the class itself is not too much to handle. The hard part is balancing this class with others, but that is the price one pays for being a student. The class itself is more of the same: marginally project-related lectures at best but neat Python lessons. It is... nice.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			Keep at it. It will only get harder from here if you are taking three or more classes -- especially if they all require team-based work.
		</p>
