		<h1>Software Engineering - Week 2 (Sept. 6 - Sept. 8)</h1>
		
		<!-- Intro paragraph and transition to Q&A section -->
		<p>
			So, it's week number two. We started to learn about assertions and unit tests, so I reckon we are slowly getting to more juicy software-engineering issues! Let's see what the third week brings!
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Now for the question-and-answer portion!
		</p>
		
		<!-- Q&A -->
		
		<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			I started work on the Collatz project and learned about a few software engineering concepts -- namely unit tests and assertions.
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
		
		<p>
			Managing my time was my biggest hurdle for the first half of this week, but I am happy to report that I have a schedule in place and I think it will work well for me.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			Now that I have a schedule, I think I will do more of the same: work on the project and read the assigned readings. I am getting into the swing of things now!
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my experience in the class?</h3>
		
		<p>
			For this week, my experience has been positive. As mentioned previously, I like Professor Downing's question-and-answer method of teaching as it engages students and makes the moment more memorable. I have no doubt that this teaching method will help in the exams.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			Attend class, do the readings, and work on the projects. Basically be a good student!
		</p>
		
		<!-- Outtro -->
		<p>
			That is it for this week. I hope to have more to talk about next week! See you then!
