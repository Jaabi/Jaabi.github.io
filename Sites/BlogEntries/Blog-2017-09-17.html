		<h1>Software Engineering - Week 3 (Sept. 11 - Sept. 15)</h1>
		
		<!-- Intro paragraph and transition to Q&A section -->
		<p>
			Welcome to week three of my Software Engineering blog! Things are already feeling normal, so I guess the schedule I made last week is working! Now to keep up the good work!
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Anyway, here are the questions and answers for this week!
		</p>
		
		<!-- Q&A -->
		
		<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			This past week I finished up the first project -- the Collatz project -- and learned more about the peculiarities of what I call "containers" in Python -- lists, sets, dictionaries, tuples, frozensets, and strings specifically. I am disappointed I did not get to implement a solution that passed all three tests on HackerRank, but I did alright in my opinion.
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
		
		<p>
			I do not think I have anything (in my power) that could stop me now that the semester is well under way. I have a schedule now, and it seems to be working! Let's hope it stays that way!
		</p>
		
		<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			Next week will be full of reading and work on project two... once it is announced, that is.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my experience in the class?</h3>
		
		<p>
			In the lectures themselves, my experience has been rather positive. We did not dive much into the readings assigned for this week, but it was worth exploring more options for the Collatz project. Talking about the caches definitely helped me implement a better solution, so I am thankful for that!
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			My tip of the week is to make sure you understand the readings. Sometimes one thinks they understood the reading and all the charts or infographics, but then a quiz will shatter that belief. I guess this is mirroring last week's tip: just be a good student. I do not think there is anything magical. Do your best!
		</p>
