		<h1>Software Engineering - Week 3 (Sept. 18 - Sept. 22)</h1>
		
		<!-- Intro paragraph and transition to Q&A section -->
		<p>
			Week four is now done! This week marks the start of the second project -- which is all about front end web development! This should be exciting stuff to learn!
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Moving on, here are my answers to the usual weekly questions!
		</p>
		
		<!-- Q&A -->
		
		<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			This past week was all kinds of busy, and this not only includes this software engineering course. Unfortunately, I spent a lot of time working on other classes, but this week will be totally focused on this second project. I turn in two other projects tomorrow, so I should definitely have a lot of time for this class!
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
		
		<p>
			Right now the only thing in my way of doing my best in this course is other courses, really. Were it not for my other two courses demanding a lot of time from me, I would have done much better. Still, I do not see how I do not have enough time to catch up this week, so things are looking good!
		</p>
		
		<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			I will focus entirely on this project, making sure I catch up with my teammates and contribute my fair share to the technical report.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my experience in the class?</h3>
		
		<p>
			So far I have experienced exactly what Professor Downing has said: the class lectures not involved with the project have little to do with the projects. That might sound tautological, but it's true: most of the class lectures are not related to the project even in theory! I suppose that is the case so that we see what it is like to work on a real-world project.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			My tip of the week is to manage one's time well. It is literally the same as all other times, but it is very important to keep up the effort when the semester is underway.
		</p>
		
		<!-- Outtro -->
		<br />
		<p>
			That is all for now. I hope you are all doing well! See you all next week!
