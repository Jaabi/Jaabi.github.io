		<h1>Software Engineering - Week 6 (Oct. 2 - Oct. 6)</h1>
		
		<!-- Intro paragraph and transition to Q&A section -->
		<p>
			And welcome to week six of the Software Engineering course! This week saw little work from this class specifically, but that has a good reason. Next week, we are having our first exam, and I am guessing that has something to do with the low amount of coursework.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Speculations aside, it is time to get to these questions!
		</p>
		
		<!-- Q&A -->
		
		<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			In the class we learned more about iterables, generators, iterators (and how they ought to implement the __iter__() and __next() methods), and studied the "yield" keyword in Python. This is all really neat (especially the "yield" keyword), and I hope to get a chance to use it in one form or another.
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
		
		<p>
			I believe this will become a trend as this semester progresses, but my other classes are getting in the way. No matter how many times I estimate the time that other class projects will take, I am always surprised by new developments. I have heard it said, "Plans are worthless, but planning is everything." It might be Dwight D. Eisenhower who said it. Regardless, I can not agree with this more as the semester progresses.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			I will take some time to study for the first exam. Other than that, I plan to work on projects for other classes; be a good student, basically.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my experience in the class?</h3>
		
		<p>
			My experience is the same as ever. I like the style of teaching and the general pace of it all. I also appreciate Professor Downing's willingness to repeat information. It really helps when it comes to remembering any concept, really.
		</p>
		
		<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
		
		<p>
			Be a good student! Work hard, study hard, and rest whenever you have the chance.
		</p>
		
		<!-- Outtro -->
		<br />
		<p>
			That is all for this week. Have a good one!
